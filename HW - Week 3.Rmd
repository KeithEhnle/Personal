  L<- J/K
  return(L)
}
  
```

#2
```{r}
install.packages(tidytuesdayR)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-09-01')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 36)

key_crop_yields <- tuesdata$key_crop_yields

M<-key_crop_yields[,3]

range(M)

"1961" 
"2018"
```

N<-key_crop_yields[,6]
O<- N[!is.na(N)]
P<-mean(O)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
