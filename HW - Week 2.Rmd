Homework 2
# 2(a)
---
Solving Equations
```{r}
"2x+5y=33"
"x+3y=19" 
```

Put the unknown variables of a equation into a vector. Vector correlated to equation is directly beneath the equation. Make sure that the x's and the y's are aligned in the martix.
```{r}
"2x+5y=33"
A<-c(2, 5)

"x+3y=19" 
B<-c(1, 3)
```

Combine the two vectors into a single matrix
```{r}
C<- rbind(A,B)
```

Put the answer to the equations into a matrix as well by making a vector first. Make sure the answers will be in the same line as equation it came from. 
```{r}
D<-c(33,19)
E<-matrix(D)
```

Use the solve function to solve the equations. Since the x's were first then the y's the first output will be the x value, and the seconf output will be the y output. 
```{r}
solve(C,D)
"x=4" 
"y=4"
```



## 2(b)
---
Finding the mean without the mean function.
```{r}
F<-(1:100)
G<- sum(F)
H<-length(F)
G/H
"50.5"
```

## 2(c)
---
Install "dplyr" package.
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

#3
---
Make a data frame of first 8 letters in the alphabet in 2 rows and 4 columns. 
```{r}
data.frame(c("A", "E"), 
               c("B", "F"),
               c("C", "G"),
               c("D", "H"))
```


Homework 3
#1
```{r}
I<- (1:100)
mean <- function(F) {
  J <- sum(F)
  K <- length(F)
  J/K
}
  
```

#2
```{r}
install.packages(tidytuesdayR)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-09-01')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 36)

key_crop_yields <- tuesdata$key_crop_yields

L<-key_crop_yields[,3]

range(L)

"1961" 
"2018"
```

#3
```{r}
M<-key_crop_yields[,6]
mean(M){options(na.rm)}
```


#4
```{r}
"#4" <- key_crop_yields[,1]
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
